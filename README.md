Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a decision tree classifier applied to the Titanic dataset. The decision tree is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, and in this case, it predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset in the machine learning community and serves as a good example for beginners to learn about data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
